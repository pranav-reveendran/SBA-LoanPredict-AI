# Cursor AI Rules for SBA Loan Prediction System
# Advanced Machine Learning Project Configuration

## Code Quality Standards
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Implement comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines with 88-character line limit
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect business context
- Implement error handling with custom exceptions

## Machine Learning Best Practices
- Separate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling
- Implement cross-validation for robust model evaluation
- Use configuration files for hyperparameters
- Log all experiments with MLflow or similar
- Implement reproducible random seeds
- Create modular, reusable components

## Business Context Awareness
- Always consider the 5:1 cost ratio in loan classification
- Focus on profit maximization over accuracy
- Implement Basel III compliance considerations
- Include explainable AI features for regulatory requirements
- Consider temporal aspects of loan data

## File Organization
- `/data/` - Raw, interim, processed datasets
- `/src/models/` - Model implementations
- `/src/features/` - Feature engineering modules
- `/src/evaluation/` - Model evaluation and metrics
- `/notebooks/` - Experimentation and analysis
- `/streamlit/` - Interactive dashboard components
- `/tests/` - Unit and integration tests

## Technology Stack Preferences
- pandas/polars for data manipulation
- scikit-learn + XGBoost/LightGBM for modeling
- streamlit for interactive interfaces
- plotly for visualizations
- SHAP for explainable AI
- optuna for hyperparameter optimization

## Documentation Requirements
- Include business impact in all function docstrings
- Explain model assumptions and limitations
- Document feature engineering rationale
- Provide examples for complex functions
- Include performance benchmarks

## Security and Compliance
- Never log sensitive customer data
- Implement data anonymization where required
- Follow GDPR/CCPA guidelines for data handling
- Ensure model fairness and bias detection
- Implement audit trails for model decisions
